#Hover

Hover matches when user hovers over with a pointing device. Provides some immediate feedback that something is clickable or requires attention.

```css
div:hover {
  background: purple;
}
```

#Focus

Focus triggers when an element receives focus, which is when an element is clicked or tabbed onto.

```css
input:focus {
  color: red;
}
```

#Active

Active triggers when an element is "being activated by user", which typically also happens during focus. For example, clicking and holding on the button would sustain the green color.

```css
button:active {
  color: green;
}
```
